# ryth

Ryth is an extremely concise language used for golfing. It mirrors the syntax of [Pyth](), but is written in Rust.

## Examples

### Hello World

Below is `hello-world.ryth`:

```
"hello world!"
```

Output is:

```
hello world!
```

### Addition

Below is the code to add 5 and 10:

```
+5 T
```

Output is:

```
15
```

## Notes

This is not nearly as complete as Pyth at this point in time, but hopfully it will be at feature parity.
