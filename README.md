# ryth

Ryth is an extremely concise language used for golfing. It mirrors the syntax of [Pyth](), but is written in Rust.

## Examples

### Hello World

Below is `hello-world.ryth`:

```
"hello world!"
```

Output is:

```
hello world!
```

### Addition

Below is the code to add 5 and 10:

```
+5 T
```

Output is:

```
15
```

## Notes

This is not nearly as complete as Pyth at this point in time, but hopfully it will be at feature parity. Also, this is not remotely possible without the work done on [Monkey](https://github.com/JoshMcguigan/monkey). It's a great example of a successful attempt of what I am trying to do here.
